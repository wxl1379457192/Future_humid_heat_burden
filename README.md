Data Preprocessing (R0-R2)
The code starting with R0-R2 performs data preprocessing before analysis.

Distributed Nonlinear Lag Model Construction (R3)
The main program for the analysis based on distributed nonlinear lag models can be found in the codes starting with R3 .

Model Validation and Sensitivity Analysis (R4.1-R4.5)
Refer to codes starting with R4.1-R4.5 for model validation and sensitivity analysis.

Future Scenario Prediction (R5)
For future scenario predictions, refer to codes starting with R5. Note that data extraction and preprocessing for future scenarios are in codes prefixed with R5p.

Data Analysis and Statistics of Prediction Results (R6)
Codes starting with R6 analyze statistics for prediction results.
